<p>Back when they were younger, Park hye-jin and Ji Sung-joon were bestfriends. The former had a stunningly gorgeous appearance and came from a wealthy family, while the latter was considered a poor, chubby and ugly boy. The two bestfriends had to part as Ji Sung-joon had to go abroad. Fast forward to when they are working as adults, Park Hye-jin recognizes her good-looking boss as Ji Sung-joon. Ji Sung-joon however, does not recognize her as his childhood bestfriend because of how ugly she became. Due to a series of events, Ji Sung-joon asks Park Hye-jin's online account to meet up with him. He does not know his childhood best friend's current appearance. Thus, because of Park Hye-jin feeling shameful about how she turned out, she asked her wealthy and beautiful friend to replace her in the meetup. Things become complicated when said friend began to develop feelings for Ji Sung-joon and he began to have his suspicions that he wasn't actually meeting with his childhood friend. </p>
